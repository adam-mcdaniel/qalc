# qalc

A language to quickly build multipurpose tools for calculations.

# Purpose

Effectively programming TI84s is ery difficult. Writing **good** programs requires managing `Lbl`s for several different menu items. Additionally, the TI84 makes writing out programs and debugging _incredibly_ difficult.

To fix this, I made a half-baked attempt at writing a language that simplifies some of these problems. The reason the language is not nearly is good as it should be is **_time_**. I made this so I can work on my homework more effectively, _not_ so I can spend all day hacking on the compiler.
